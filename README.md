## How to install

- extract the package using dpkg to the desired location
```bash
dpkg -x /path/to/push-swap-visualizer_1.0.0_amd64.deb ~/Desktop

- and then go to the path you extracted the package, in my case ~/Desktop/usr/bin and run the executable
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/usr/bin
chmod u+x push_swap_visualizer
./push_swap_visualizer &
```

or just add an alias in your ~/.zshrc file

```bash
alias psv="/path/to/push_swap_visualizer &"
```

```bash
psv
```

otherwise just run this command if you have admin rights
```bash
dpkg -i /path/to/push-swap-visualizer_1.0.0_amd64.deb
